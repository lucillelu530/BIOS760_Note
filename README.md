# BIOS760_Note
Some notes about measure theory and advanced probability (Lets learn real analysis ten times :(

##Structure (to be determined)
### Class note
A notebook that would be updated after each class (including the lecture material and some problems I encountered, and the answers were also included, which were provided by my friends who were majored in pure math. What's more, such answers were also collected through Stackexchange or Zhihu)

### Review Note
I intended to create a notebook for summary (maybe in mindmap form? not sure) before exam. There's so many content in the class and I have to rewrite my class note in another new notebook to catch up with the pace of lecture.
